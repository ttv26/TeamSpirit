        <div>
            <img src="e1.jpg" alt="Project 1">
            <p><strong>Project 1:</strong> 
                The bridge project, led by skilled civil engineers, involves meticulous planning, innovative design, and advanced structural engineering. Employing modern techniques such as prefabrication and prioritizing safety measures, these projects contribute to efficient infrastructure development while embracing environmental sustainability.</p>

        <!-- Project 2 -->
        <div>
            <img src="e2.jpg" alt="Project 2">
            <p><strong>Project 2:</strong> Description of Project 2. Civil engineers meticulously plan and design bridges, considering factors like topography and traffic requirements. Structural engineering principles ensure their stability, and modern construction techniques, such as prefabrication, enhance efficiency. Bridges not only provide vital transportation links but also stand as symbols of innovation and connectivity in civil engineering.

        <div>
            <img src="g1.jpg" alt="Project 3">
            <p><strong>Project 3:</strong> Description of Project 3. The Golden Gate Bridge, an iconic symbol of San Francisco, is a breathtaking engineering marvel that spans the Golden Gate Strait, connecting the city to Marin County. Completed in 1937, this suspension bridge designed by Joseph Strauss and Irving Morrow stands as a testament to both beauty and functionality. Its distinctive International Orange color, chosen for visibility in the city's frequent fog, adds to its allure. The Golden Gate Bridge is not only a vital transportation link but also a globally recognized landmark, drawing millions of visitors annually to admire its grandeur and panoramic views of the Bay Area.

            <img src="t1.jpg" alt="Project 4">
            <p><strong>Project 4:</strong> Description of Project 4. One World Trade Center, also known as the Freedom Tower, stands as an iconic symbol of resilience and reconstruction in Lower Manhattan, New York City. Completed in 2014, this architectural marvel rises 1,776 feet (541 meters) into the sky, paying homage to the year of America's independence. Designed by David Childs of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the tower combines cutting-edge sustainability features with a striking design. It stands as a powerful tribute to the strength of the human spirit and serves as a beacon of hope, commemorating the lives lost on September 11, 2001, and marking a new era of progress and unity.

        <!-- Achievement 1 -->
        <div>
            <p><strong>Achievement 1:</strong> Recognition for innovative solutions in classic architecture.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Achievement 2 -->
        <div>
            <p><strong>Achievement 2:</strong> Completion of projects ahead of schedule and within budget.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Achievement 3 -->
        <div>
            <p><strong>Achievement 3:</strong> Bridges are an essential part of our infrastructure. They allow us to cross rivers, valleys, and other obstacles that would otherwise be impassable. Bridges also play a vital role in our economy, as they facilitate the transportation of goods and people. In recent years, there have been a number of significant achievements in bridge engineering. One of the most notable is the development of new materials that are stronger and lighter than traditional materials, such as steel and concrete. These new materials allow engineers to build bridges that are longer, taller, and more slender than ever before. Another major achievement is the development of new construction techniques. These techniques allow engineers to build bridges more quickly and efficiently than ever before. As a result of these advances, we are now able to build bridges that would have been impossible just a few decades ago.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Achievement 4 -->
        <div>
            <p><strong>Achievement 4:</strong>The Golden Gate Bridge is an iconic landmark in San Francisco that spans the Golden Gate, the one-mile-wide (1.6 km) strait connecting San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean. Completed in 1937, it was the longest suspension bridge in the world at the time of its completion and is still the longest suspension bridge in the United States.</p>
